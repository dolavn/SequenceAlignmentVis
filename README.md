# SequenceAlignmentVis
A tool to visualize various sequence alignment algoirthms, used in computational biology,
such as Needleman–Wunsch algorithm for global alignment of two strings, and Smith–Waterman algorithm
for local alignment of two strings.

You can also visualize in this tool multiple sequence alignment of three strings.
